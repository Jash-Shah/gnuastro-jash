# Common funcitons of Bash auto-completion in Gnuastro. For more details on
# completion, see the "autocomplete feature" section under the "Developing"
# chapter of Gnuastro's manual and the comments below.
#
# This script contains generic functions that can be used by all the
# programs. Each program also has its own '*-complete.bash' file that will
# use the generic functions here and define all the internal variables that
# these functions take as input/output. During the installation, all those
# '*-complete.bash' files will be appended to this (and installed as one
# file to be loaded into the user's '.bashrc').
#
# Because the combined file is loaded into the user's Bash environment
# every time, we don't want to complicate the user's environment with
# global environment variables. As a result, all the functions used in the
# Bash auto-completion should be 'local' (to that particular function and
# the functions it calls).
#
# To debug/test this script, you can take these steps after building
# Gnuastro in the program's 'bin/progname/astprogname-complete.bash'
# file. Building Gnuastro is necessary because one of the files
#
#    1. Uncomment the two 'source' lines in the program's completion
#       script.
#    2. Correct the un-commented locations. Note that the second is an
#       automatically built file (it is not under version control or in the
#       source directory). So in case you have defined a separate build
#       directory, give that directory. If you are building within your
#       source (which is generally a bad idea!), it will be the same
#       directory.
#    3. Give a value to the 'gnuastro_prefix' variable within
#       '_gnuastro_autocomplete_astprogname'. This is the location that
#       Gnuastro is installed in your OS (usually '/usr/local/bin').
#    4. Activate the program's script with this command in the terminal you
#       are testing: 'source bin/progname/astprogname-complete.bash' (here
#       assuming you are in the top Gnuastro source directory, you can run
#       it from anywhere, just correct the locatation).
